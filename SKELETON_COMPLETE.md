## Build Verification ✅

Both projects build successfully:

**Backend:**
```bash
cd backend/SongsterGame.Api
dotnet build
# ✓ Build succeeded - 0 errors
```

**Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
# ✓ Built in 1.49s - production ready
```

## How to Run

### 1. Start Backend
```bash
cd backend/SongsterGame.Api
dotnet run
```
API runs at: `http://localhost:5000`

### 2. Start Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install  # First time only
npm run dev
```
App runs at: `http://localhost:5173`

### 3. Test Multiplayer
1. Open `http://localhost:5173` in first browser tab
2. Click "Create Game" with a nickname
3. Copy the 8-character game code
4. Open `http://localhost:5173` in another tab (or incognito)
5. Click "Join Game", enter the code and a different nickname
6. In the first tab (host), click "Start Game"
7. Test turn-based card placement

## Current Game Flow

1. **Create/Join** → Players connect via SignalR
2. **Lobby** → Wait for 2-4 players, host starts
3. **Playing** → Turn-based card placement
   - Current player sees a music card
   - Player chooses timeline position
   - Backend validates (year-based chronology)
   - Valid = card added, Invalid = card discarded
   - Turn rotates to next player
4. **Finish** → First to 10 cards wins

## Mock Data

Currently using 10 classic songs for testing:
- Billie Jean (1983)
- Bohemerian Rhapsody (1975)
- Smells Like Teen Spirit (1991)
- Hey Jude (1968)

- Thriller (1982)
- Imagine (1971)
- Sweet Child O' Mine (1987)
- Hotel California (1976)
- Lose Yourself (2002)
