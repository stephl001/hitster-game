# Trunk-Based Development Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the trunk-based development model and automated deployment setup for the Hitster Game project, optimized for solo development.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Branch Structure

✅ **Single `main` branch (trunk)** - Single source of truth for all development
- Direct commits allowed (solo developer)
- Auto-deploys to Azure dev environment on every push
- Production deployments triggered by version tags

✅ **Deleted `develop` branch** - No longer needed for solo development
- Simplified workflow without branching overhead
- Faster iteration cycles

### 2. GitHub Actions Workflows

**Optimized workflows to only deploy what changed:**

✅ **Created `.github/workflows/deploy-dev-backend.yml`**
- Triggers on push to `main` when `backend/**` changes
- Deploys only backend to `app-songster-api-dev`

✅ **Created `.github/workflows/deploy-dev-frontend.yml`**
- Triggers on push to `main` when `frontend/**` changes
- Deploys only frontend to `stapp-songster-web-dev`

✅ **Created `.github/workflows/deploy-prod-backend.yml`**
- Triggers on push of version tags (v*)
- Deploys backend to `app-songster-api-prod`
- Displays version number in deployment summary

✅ **Created `.github/workflows/deploy-prod-frontend.yml`**
- Triggers on push of version tags (v*)
- Deploys frontend to `stapp-songster-web-prod`
- Uses separate Static Web App token: `AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APP_API_TOKEN_PROD`
- Displays version number in deployment summary

**Benefits of split workflows:**
- Faster deployments (only deploy what changed)
- Parallel deployments for production (both run simultaneously)
- Clearer deployment logs and history

### 3. Documentation

✅ **Updated `CLAUDE.md`**
- Replaced GitHub Flow documentation with trunk-based development
- Added version tagging conventions
- Documented simplified deployment workflow
- Updated "Other Instructions" section for trunk-based approach

✅ **Updated `docs/BRANCH_PROTECTION_SETUP.md`**
- Updated for trunk-based development approach
- Simplified branch protection (main only)
- GitHub Environments setup instructions
- Required GitHub secrets documentation

✅ **Updated `docs/BRANCHING_MODEL_SUMMARY.md`** (this file)
- Reflects trunk-based development implementation
- Simplified workflow documentation

## Trunk-Based Development Model

### Branch Structure

```
main (trunk - single source of truth)
  └── hotfix/* (only for emergencies, rare)
```

### Development Flow

1. **Daily Development:**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   # Make changes
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add feature"
   git push origin main
   # → Auto-deploys to DEV environment
   ```

2. **Testing & Verification:**
   - Test on Azure dev environment
   - Fix issues with additional commits to main

3. **Production Deployment:**
   ```bash
   # Tag for production release
   git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"
   git push origin v1.0.0
   # → Auto-deploys to PROD environment
   ```

4. **Hotfix (Production Emergency - Rare):**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b hotfix/critical-issue
   # Fix issue
   # PR to main, merge
   git tag -a v1.0.1 -m "Hotfix: Critical issue"
   git push origin v1.0.1
   ```

## Deployment Triggers

| Trigger | Component | Environment | Workflow | Deploys To |
|---------|-----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| Push to `main` (backend changes) | Backend | Dev | `deploy-dev-backend.yml` | `app-songster-api-dev` |
| Push to `main` (frontend changes) | Frontend | Dev | `deploy-dev-frontend.yml` | `stapp-songster-web-dev` |
| Tag `v*` | Backend | Prod | `deploy-prod-backend.yml` | `app-songster-api-prod` |
| Tag `v*` | Frontend | Prod | `deploy-prod-frontend.yml` | `stapp-songster-web-prod` |

**Note:** Production tags trigger both backend and frontend workflows in parallel.

## Next Steps: Manual Configuration Required

### 1. Configure Branch Protection Rules on GitHub (Optional)

For solo development, branch protection is optional. However, you may want to:

- [ ] Set up basic protection for `main` branch (optional)
  - Block force pushes (recommended)
  - Require linear history (recommended)
  - Allow direct pushes (required for trunk-based development)

### 2. Configure GitHub Environments

- [ ] Create `dev` environment in GitHub repository settings
  - No deployment protection rules needed
  - Add dev-specific secrets if needed

- [ ] Create `prod` environment in GitHub repository settings
  - Add required reviewers for production deployments
  - Add prod-specific secrets

### 3. Add Required GitHub Secrets

Ensure these secrets exist at the repository level:

- [ ] `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` - Azure service principal for deployments
- [ ] `AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APP_API_TOKEN` - Dev Static Web App deployment token
- [ ] `AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APP_API_TOKEN_PROD` - Prod Static Web App deployment token
- [ ] `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` - Spotify application client ID
- [ ] `GH_PAT` - GitHub Personal Access Token (for auto-secret configuration)

### 4. Deploy Infrastructure to Both Environments

Run the infrastructure deployment workflow twice (once for each environment):

```bash
# Deploy dev infrastructure
# GitHub Actions → azure-infrastructure.yml → Run workflow → Select "dev"

# Deploy prod infrastructure
# GitHub Actions → azure-infrastructure.yml → Run workflow → Select "prod"
```

### 5. Test the Workflows

- [ ] Make a small change and commit to `main`
- [ ] Push to `main` branch
- [ ] Verify `deploy-dev.yml` workflow runs successfully
- [ ] Create a version tag (e.g., `v0.1.0`)
- [ ] Push the tag
- [ ] Verify `deploy-prod.yml` workflow runs successfully

## Benefits of Trunk-Based Development

✅ **Simplified Workflow** - No branching overhead, commit directly to main

✅ **Faster Iteration** - Push changes and see them deployed to dev immediately

✅ **Automated Testing** - Every commit is tested on dev environment automatically

✅ **Explicit Versioning** - Production releases are clearly tagged with semantic versions

✅ **Easy Rollback** - Re-push any previous tag to rollback production

✅ **Perfect for Solo Development** - No ceremony, no PRs, no waiting for approvals

✅ **Environment Isolation** - Dev (main branch) and prod (version tags) are clearly separated

## Troubleshooting

### Workflow Fails on First Run

If the deployment workflows fail on the first run, ensure:
1. Both dev and prod infrastructure has been deployed via `azure-infrastructure.yml`
2. All required secrets are configured in GitHub repository settings
3. GitHub Environments (`dev` and `prod`) exist in repository settings

### Static Web App Deployment Token Issues

If frontend deployment fails with authentication errors:
1. Run `azure-infrastructure.yml` workflow for the environment
2. Verify the deployment token was set in GitHub secrets
3. Check that the correct secret name is used:
   - Dev: `AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APP_API_TOKEN`
   - Prod: `AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APP_API_TOKEN_PROD`

### Backend Deployment Fails

If backend deployment fails:
1. Verify Azure App Service exists for the environment
2. Check that `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret has proper permissions
3. Ensure the App Service name matches the workflow (e.g., `app-songster-api-dev`)
